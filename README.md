# 🎯 User Engagement Calculator in Dart

Welcome to my Dart project showcasing a user engagement calculator! This project demonstrates my progress in Dart programming, incorporating more advanced concepts and practical applications.

## 🚀 Project Description

This Dart program implements:
- 👤 User profile creation with follower and following counts
- ⏱️ Watch time calculation and conversion
- 👍 Engagement measurement based on watch time and likes
- 📊 Engagement status determination
- 🖨️ Formatted output of user profile and engagement metrics

## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I gained insights into:
- 🌱 Advanced variable declaration and initialization in Dart
- 🧮 Arithmetic operations and type conversions
- 🔀 Conditional statements for logic implementation
- 💬 Complex string interpolation and multi-line strings
- 🏗️ Structuring code for readability and maintainability

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. Ensure you have Dart SDK installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run the following command:
   ```
   dart run main.dart
   ```
## 🔮 Future Improvements

I'm excited to expand this project with:
- 📊 User input for dynamic profile creation
- 📈 More sophisticated engagement algorithms
- 💾 Data persistence using file I/O or a simple database
- 📱 A graphical user interface using Flutter
